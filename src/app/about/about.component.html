            <p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Hi Peps a warm welcome to My Portfolio, Where you can find links to my social media and some of my work :) Yeah... You can ask, Why ..? For What ..? Well as you already gussed , Yes..this entire web app was build by myself and ofCourse Google
                and all free resource by using firebase..., ¬_¬ Well this is About Me right! So-So here we go… <em> I’m an Engineer, Who is passionate about Photography and works in IT.</em> Simple right, Well that line costs five years :) Photography started in my
                life in a way like one random day, me carrying a DSLR and trying to figure it out its features, Don't even know how to hold it properly & trying to capture a bird flying over my head. I'm like swinging the camera in all direction and randomly clicking the
                button whenever, I saw that bird in viewfinder and 'Just like That' randomly I got <a (click)="openbarcode()" style="color: dodgerblue;cursor: pointer;">this</a>. Awesome Nah..!,Yes I can't belive it either :-| Later I got my own Cam and chose Engineering, Learned many things except engineering :/
                then..bla bla covid bla...Not An End, If you still want hear some meaningless stories do Follow.
